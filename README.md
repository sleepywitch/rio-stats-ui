# Project Rio UI

[Project Rio](https://www.projectrio.online) | [Project Rio Stats API](https://github.com/ProjectRio/ProjectRio-web) | [Project Rio Discord](https://discord.gg/ZMFCuvwAyH)

Hello! This is a prototype user interface to access Project Rio Stats. Currently only the game basic search, batting stats by character and by player are functioning.

## How to Run

Run `ng serve --open` in the root directory. for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## How to Develop

Familiarity with angular - bootstrap - typescript/json - npm - html are all good starting points. This is the list of local installs I had to do to get this running. You may have to do the same:

* `npm i @angular/cli`
* `nom i @angular/cdk`
* `npm i @angular/material`
* `npm i @ng-table`
* `npm i postcss-custom-selectors`
