# Project Rio UI

[Project Rio](https://www.projectrio.online) | [Project Rio Stats API](https://github.com/ProjectRio/ProjectRio-web) | [Project Rio Discord](https://discord.gg/ZMFCuvwAyH)

Hello! This is a prototype user interface to access Project Rio Stats. As of current the only functioning web pages are the game basic search, and batting stats by player, leader, and all characters.

## How to Run

1. Have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Run `npm install -g @angular/cli` which installs angular/cli globally
3. Run `npm install` in the project root
4. Run `ng serve --open` in the root directory.
5. Your default browser should automatically open a tab at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## How to Develop

Familiarity with angular - bootstrap - typescript/json - npm - html are all good starting points. 
If you haven't run `npm install` above, start there. Then use an IDE such as Visual Studio Code (free) or Intellij (paid)

**TIP**: The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Other Dependencies

In case you need them; there might be more

* `npm i @angular/cli`
* `nom i @angular/cdk`
* `npm i @angular/material`
* `npm i @ng-table`
