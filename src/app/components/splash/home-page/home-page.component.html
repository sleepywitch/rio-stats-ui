<h2>Welcome to the demo for the Project Rio Mario Stats UI by sleepywitch</h2>
<br/>
<p>Currently for the demo only a couple of pages are working:
<br/><br/>
  Games > Basic Search<br/>
  Batting Stats > By Player<br/>
  Batting Stats > Leaderboard<br/>
  Batting Stats > All Characters<br/><br/>
Each of these pages has the basic search working. The batting stats have fully functional tables.<br/>
